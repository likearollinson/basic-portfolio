<h3>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</h3>
<p>
    An underrated Tarantino flick with an interesting plot and cast of
    characters and seems to capture LA of the 60s
</p>
<h3>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</h3>
<p>A fun movie that captures what it means to take advantage of youth</p>
<h3>The Back to the Future Series</h3>
<p>Just classic popcorn cinema that makes me happy</p>
