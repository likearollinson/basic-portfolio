<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    My name is Brad and I am currently in tech sales, but like to do web
    development as a hobby. Maybe one day it could be a career, but for now it
    is just for fun while I hone my skills!
</p>

<p>I enjoy tech, music, learning, golf, and just being outdoors in general!</p>
